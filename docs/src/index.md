# SpeedyWeather.jl documentation

Welcome to the documentation for [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/milankl/SpeedyWeather.jl) a global
atmospheric circulation model with simple parametrizations to represent physical processes such as clouds,
precipitation and radiation.

## Overview

SpeedyWeather.jl is a global spectral model that uses a spherical harmonic transform to perform some calculations
in spectral space (time integration, gradients, linear terms) and some in grid-point space (advection, non-linear terms,
parameterizations).
The prognostic variables used are vorticity, divergence, absolute temperature, logarithm of surface
pressure and specific humidity. The time stepping uses a leapfrog scheme with additional filters and a
semi-implicit formulation for gravity waves. The default resolution is T31 (96x48 grid points on a
regular Gaussian grid, about 400km at the Equator) and 8 vertical levels.

Simple parameterizations are used to represent the physical processes convection, large-scale condensation,
clouds, short-wave radiation, long-waves radiation, surface fluxes of momentum and energy, and vertical diffusion.
