# How to run SpeedyWeather.jl

Creating a SpeedyWeather.jl simulation and running it consists conceptually of 4 steps

1. Create a `SpectralGrid` which defines the grid and spectral resolution
2. Create a model
3. Initialize a model to obtain a `Simulation`.
4. Run the simulation.

In the following we will describe these steps in more detail,
but let's start with some examples first.

## Example 1: 2D turbulence on a non-rotating sphere

We want to use the barotropic model to simulate some free-decaying 2D turbulence
on the sphere without rotation. We start by defining the `SpectralGrid` object.
To have a resolution of about 100km, we choose a spectral resolution of
T127 (see [Available resolutions](@ref)) and `nlev=1` vertical levels.
The `SpectralGrid` object will provide us with some more information
```@example howtorun
using SpeedyWeather

spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=127,nlev=1)
```
We could have specified further options, but let's ignore that for now.
Next step we create a planet that's like Earth but not rotating
```@example howtorun
still_earth = Earth(rotation=0)
```
There are other options to create a planet but they are irrelevant for the
barotropic vorticity equations. We also want to specify the initial conditions,
randomly distributed vorticity is already defined
```@example howtorun
initial_conditions = StartWithRandomVorticity()
```
By default, the power of vorticity is spectrally distributed with ``k^{-3}``, ``k`` being the
horizontal wavenumber, and the amplitude is ``10^{-5}\text{s}^{-1}``.

Now we want to construct a `BarotropicModel`
with these
```@example howtorun
model = BarotropicModel(;spectral_grid, initial_conditions, planet=still_earth);
nothing # hide
```
The `model` contains all the parameters, but isn't initialized yet, which we can do
with and then run it. The `run!` command will always return the prognostic variables, which, by default, are 
plotted for surface relative vorticity with a unicode plot. The resolution of the plot
is not necessarily representative but it lets us have a quick look at the result
```@example howtorun
simulation = initialize!(model)
run!(simulation,n_days=30)
```

Woohoo! I can see turbulence! You could pick up where this simulation stopped by simply
doing `run!(simulation,n_days=50)` again. We didn't store any output, which
you can do by `run!(simulation,output=true)`, which will switch on NetCDF output
with default settings. More options on output in [NetCDF output](@ref).

## Example 2: Shallow water with mountains

As a second example, let's investigate the Galewsky et al.[^1] test case for the shallow
water equations with and without mountains. As the shallow water system has also only
one level, we can reuse the `SpectralGrid` from Example 1.
```@example howtorun
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=127,nlev=1)
```
Now as a first simulation, we want to disable any orography, so we create a `NoOrography`
```@example howtorun
orography = NoOrography(spectral_grid)
```
Although the orography is zero, you have to pass on `spectral_grid` so that it can
still initialize zero-arrays of the right size and element type. Awesome.
This time the initial conditions should be set the the Galewsky et al.[^1] zonal
jet, which is already defined as
```@example howtorun
initial_conditions = ZonalJet()
```
The jet sits at 45ËšN with a maximum velocity of 80m/s and a perturbation as described in their paper.
Now we construct a model, but this time a `ShallowWaterModel`
```@example howtorun
model = ShallowWaterModel(;spectral_grid, orography, initial_conditions)
simulation = initialize!(model);
run!(simulation,n_days=6)
```
Oh yeah. That looks like the wobbly jet in their paper. Let's run it again for another 6 days
but this time also store [NetCDF output](@ref).
```@example howtorun
run!(simulation,n_days=6,output=true)
```
The progress bar tells us that the simulation run got the identification "0001"
(which just counts up, so yours might be higher), meaning that
data is stored in the folder `/run_0001`, so let's plot that data properly (and not just using UnicodePlots).
```@example howtorun
using PyPlot, NCDatasets
ds = NCDataset("run_0001/output.nc");
ds["vor"]
```
Vorticity `vor` is stored as a 384x192x1x25 array, we may want to look at the first time step,
which is the end of the previous simulation (time=6days) which we didn't store output for.
```@example howtorun
vor = ds["vor"][:,:,1,1];
lat = ds["lat"][:];
lon = ds["lon"][:];
pcolormesh(lon,lat,vor')
nothing # hide
```
Which looks like

You see that the unicode plot heavily coarse-grains the simulation, well it's unicode after all!
And now the last time step, that means time = 12days is
```@example howtorun
vor = ds["vor"][:,:,1,25];
pcolormesh(lon,lat,vor')
```

![Galewsky jet pyplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl/main/docs/img/galewsky_nc_12days.png)

The jet broke up into many small eddies, but the turbulence is still confined to the northern hemisphere, cool!
How this may change when we add mountains (we had `NoOrography` above!), say Earth's orography, you may ask?
Let's try it out! We create an `EarthOrography` struct like so

```@example howtorun
orography = EarthOrography(spectral_grid)
```

It will read the orography from file as shown, and there are some smoothing options too, but let's not change them.
Same as before, create a model, intialize into a simulation, run. This time directly for 12 days so that we can
compare with the last plot
```@example howtorun
model = ShallowWaterModel(;spectral_grid, orography, initial_conditions);
simulation = initialize!(model);
run!(simulation,n_days=12,output=true)
```
This time the run got a new run id, `0002` in our case, but otherwise we do as before.

Interesting! The initial conditions have zero velocity in the southern hemisphere, but still, one can see
some imprint of the orography on vorticity. You can spot the coastline of Antarctica; the Andes and
Greenland are somewhat visible too. Mountains also completely changed the flow after 12 days,
probably not surprising!

## SpectralGrid

The life of every SpeedyWeather.jl simulation starts with a `SpectralGrid` object.
We have seen some examples above, now let's look into the details

```@example howtorun
?SpectralGrid
```
